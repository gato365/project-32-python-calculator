# Project 32 - Python Calculator for Educators

## About the Project
Welcome to the Python Calculator Project! This repository hosts a Python-based calculator designed as an educational tool to illustrate core programming concepts. It's perfect for teachers who aim to introduce their students to the basics of Python including functions, loops, and conditional statements.

## Educational Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to help students understand basic mathematical operations through coding.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: A simple command-line interface that encourages students to interact with the program, enhancing their engagement and learning.
- **Error Handling**: Teaches students how software can gracefully manage unexpected or incorrect user inputs.

## Installation for Classroom Use
To use this calculator in your classroom, ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Set up the calculator by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gato365/project-32-python-calculator.git
```

## Classroom Usage
After navigating to the cloned directory, you can run the Python script with your students:
```bash
cd project-32-python-calculator
python calculator.py
```
Engage your students by having them perform calculations, predict outcomes, and understand the flow of the program.
